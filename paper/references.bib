The Cassio code is used to simulate thermal radiation flow through inhomogeneous, stochastic-media-foam configurations containing optically thick clumps dispersed within an optically thin background aerogel. Cassio can model small inhomogeneous problems directly, but most problems require approximations to meet computer limitations on run-times and memory usage. Various examples of these approximations are methods that produce, in one calculation, an ensemble-averaged solution and associated standard deviation; reduced spatial dimensionality with approximate geometries; and full material homogenization with no geometric detail. Cassio simulations are used to design experiments at the OMEGA-60 Laser Facility that can measure the radiation flow using the spatially resolved COAX absorption spectroscopy diagnostic. The experimental platforms flow radiation through foam targets ranging from a background-only aerogel, to a single configuration of a specified stochastic medium, to a fully homogenized foam of the background and clump materials. Under constant total clump mass, larger clumps (here, larger than 10 μm diameter) will mix more slowly with the background such that the bulk radiation flow is faster than it would be in a fully homogenized material. The COAX platform can be used to infer temperature and density profiles in both the background material and clumps, simultaneously, and therefore to differentiate radiation flow in a range of stochastic and homogeneous media.}, number={4}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Byvank, T. and Coffing, S.

Plasmas 29, 083302 (2022)]. This new platform will enable future astrophysical experiments involving supernova shock breakout, such as Radishock (Johns et al., Laboratory for Laser Energetics Annual Report 338, 2020) on OMEGA-60 [Boehly et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 66, 508 (1995)], and stochastic media (such as XFOL on OMEGA). Greater energy and larger physical scale on NIF [Moses et al., Eur. Phys. J. D 44, 215 (2007)] will enable a greater travel distance of radiation flow, higher density, and more manufacturable foams and enable exploration of a greater range of radiation behavior than achievable in the prior OMEGA experiments. This publication will describe the baseline configuration for the Xflows experimental campaign and the roadmap to achieve its primary objectives.}, number={2}, journal={Review of Scientific Instruments}, author={Johns, Heather M. and Byvank, Tom and Robey, Harry and Urbatsch, Todd and Coffing, Shane and Fryer, Christopher L. and Perry, Theodore S. and Kozlowski, Pawel M. and Fontes, Christopher J. and Love, Kevin and Meyerhofer, D.

However, their limited size can preclude single component characterization, forcing one to rely solely on less accurate bulk measurements. We have developed a monochromatic imaging system to characterize both the density and uniformity of single component low-mass foams. This x-ray assembly is capable of determining line-averaged density variations near the 1% level, and provides statistically identical results to those obtained at the Brookhaven’s NSLS. This system has the added benefit of providing two-dimensional density data, allowing an assessment of density uniformity.}, number={10}, journal={Review of Scientific Instruments}, author={Lanier, N.
