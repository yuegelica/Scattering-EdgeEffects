# Scattering-EdgeEffects
The project aims to investigate whether the inconsistent measurements seen at the edges of an aerogel foam sample are a consequence of some sort of scattering mechanism (whether due to the porosity, surface mechanisms like refraction, or something else entirely). 
## Motivation

## Instructions to Run
### Required Installations
Installing a virtual envionment is recommended:
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib mendeleev
```
### Dependencies
Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yuegelica/Scattering-EdgeEffects.git
```

### Running the Simulation
There are 4 different plots this project can produce. The main plot of the intensity distribution can be generated in the main.py file. To generate a Transmimssion plot identical to ones found on https://henke.lbl.gov/, run the transmissionplot.py file.
