# Scattering-EdgeEffects
The project aims to investigate whether the inconsistent measurements seen at the edges of an aerogel foam sample are a consequence of some sort of scattering mechanism (whether due to the porosity, surface mechanisms like refraction, or something else entirely). 
## Motivation

## Instructions to Run
### Required Installations

```
### Dependencies
Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Cloning the Repository
