# Scattering-EdgeEffects
The project aims to investigate whether the inconsistent measurements seen at the edges of an aerogel foam sample are a consequence of some sort of scattering mechanism (whether due to the porosity, surface mechanisms like refraction, or something else entirely). 
## Motivation
